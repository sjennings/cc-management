# CLAUDE.md Style Guide Maintainer

Ultrathink: Walk through the ENTIRE project and:
- determine what programming language is being used
- determine what libraries and platforms are being used
- update your Claude.md based on best practices for best practices for those languages/platforms.
- this may be run iteratively, edit best practices that are already present. Do NOT remove ANYTHING, merely append. 
- Consult with Zen if the MCP server is available.
- Consult with context7 if the MCP server is available.
