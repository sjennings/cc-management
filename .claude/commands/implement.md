# implement.md

Work out a test-driven implementation (for every feature, write the test first, knowing it will fail, then write the code to make the test pass) for $ARGUMENTS. Ask me when you are looking at making choices related to this implementation. When done, write the plan out to the sprint directory. Ultrathink.
