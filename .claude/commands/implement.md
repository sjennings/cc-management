# implement.md

Create goal-focused implementation phases for $ARGUMENTS. Each phase should deliver a working, testable milestone.

## PLANNING

Work out a complete, detailed implementation plan. Ultrathink.
Ask me when you are looking at making choices related to this implementation.
When done, write the plan out to the sprint directory.

## IMPLEMENTATION

üéØ PHASE-BASED IMPLEMENTATION
Goal: Break your project into phases where each phase delivers something that works and can be tested.

Phase Template
For each phase, answer:

What works after this phase? (testable milestone)
How do you test it? (validation method)
What's the next logical step? (next phase goal)
üìã IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
Phase 1: [Core Foundation]
Goal: Get the most basic version working

Deliverable: What can you demo/test after this phase?

Tasks:

 Setup task 1
 Core feature 1
 Basic test
Success Test: How do you know this phase works?

Duration: X days/weeks

Phase 2: [First Extension]
Goal: Add the next most important piece

Deliverable: What new capability does this unlock?

Tasks:

 Extension task 1
 Integration task
 Test the combination
Success Test: How do you validate the new functionality?

Duration: X days/weeks

Phase 3: [Second Extension]
Goal: Build on what you have

Deliverable: What's the next working milestone?

Tasks:

 Enhancement task 1
 Polish task
 End-to-end test
Success Test: How do you verify it works end-to-end?

Duration: X days/weeks

Phase 4: [Polish & Deploy]
Goal: Make it production-ready

Deliverable: Deployed, working system

Tasks:

 Deployment setup
 Performance testing
 Documentation
Success Test: Can others use it successfully?

Duration: X days/weeks

üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

We are using test driven development: for every feature, write the test first, knowing it will fail, then write the code to make the test pass

Phase 1: Simple manual test - does basic flow work? Phase 2: Integration test - do parts work together? Phase 3: Feature test - does extended functionality work? Phase 4: User test - can real users accomplish their goals?

üìù PHASE TRACKING
 Phase 1 - ‚è≥ Not Started
 Phase 2 - ‚è≥ Not Started
 Phase 3 - ‚è≥ Not Started
 Phase 4 - ‚è≥ Not Started
Current Phase: Phase 1 Next Milestone: Date when Phase 1 should be complete

üí° EXAMPLE PHASES
Research Agent Example:

Phase 1: Single query ‚Üí response (test: ask one question, get answer)
Phase 2: Multi-step research (test: complex question requiring multiple searches)
Phase 3: Source validation (test: verify sources are accurate)
Phase 4: Report generation (test: create formatted research report)
Web App Example:

Phase 1: User login + basic UI (test: user can sign up and see dashboard)
Phase 2: Core feature working (test: main user workflow end-to-end)
Phase 3: Data persistence (test: data survives page refresh)
Phase 4: Production deployment (test: works for real users)
E-commerce Site Example:

Phase 1: Product display (test: browse products, see details)
Phase 2: Shopping cart (test: add items, modify quantities)
Phase 3: Checkout process (test: complete purchase flow)
Phase 4: Order management (test: track orders, handle returns)
API Service Example:

Phase 1: Basic CRUD endpoints (test: create, read, update, delete records)
Phase 2: Authentication (test: protected routes work with tokens)
Phase 3: Business logic (test: complex operations work correctly)
Phase 4: Production ready (test: handles load, has monitoring)
Remember: Each phase should give you something you can actually use and test. If you can't test it, the phase isn't complete.

When finished, report completion along with the current state of project implementation and progress.
