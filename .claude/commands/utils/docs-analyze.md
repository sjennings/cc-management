Walk through every directory (not the root directory) and, if a CLAUDE.md file exists in that directory, update it with information on what lives in that directory/what it is used for. Create a new CLAUDE.md file if one does not exist.

Then, walk through the WHOLE project and update CLAUDE.md in the root directory based on the changes made to the project.

Ultrathink.
