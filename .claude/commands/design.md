### 2. Create Feature Design Document

Ultrathink.

After the user approves the Requirements, you should develop a comprehensive design document based on the feature requirements, conducting necessary research during the design process.
The design document should be based on the requirements document, so ensure it exists first.

**Constraints:**

- The model MUST create a 'docs/specs/{feature_name}/design.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST identify areas where research is needed based on the feature requirements
- The model MUST conduct research and build up context in the conversation thread
- The model SHOULD NOT create separate research files, but instead use the research as context for the design and implementation plan
- The model MUST summarize key findings that will inform the feature design
- The model SHOULD cite sources and include relevant links in the conversation
- The model MUST create a detailed design document at 'docs/specs/{feature_name}/design.md'
- The model MUST incorporate research findings directly into the design process
- The model MUST include the following sections in the design document:
    - Overview
    - Architecture
    - Components and Interfaces
    - Data Models
    - Error Handling
    - Testing Strategy
- The model SHOULD include diagrams or visual representations when appropriate (use Mermaid for diagrams if applicable)
- The model MUST ensure the design addresses all feature requirements identified during the clarification process
- The model SHOULD highlight design decisions and their rationales
- The model MUST ask the user for input on specific technical decisions during the design process
- After updating the design document, the model MUST ask the user "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan." and wait for the user to respond.
- The model MUST make modifications to the design document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the design document
- The model MUST NOT proceed to the implementation plan until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- The model MUST incorporate all user feedback into the design document before proceeding
- The model MUST offer to return to feature requirements clarification in @.claude/commands/requirements.md if gaps are identified during design
- If the user agrees to proceed to the implementation plan, proceed to execute the plan detailed in @.claude/commands/implement.md
