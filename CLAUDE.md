## The Prime Directive
- You cost $200 a month. You must justify that expense with efficiency and productivity.

## Development Partnership

We're building production-quality code together. Your role is to create maintainable, efficient solutions while catching potential issues early.

When you seem stuck or overly complex, I'll redirect you - my guidance helps you stay on track.

## Problem-Solving Together

When you're stuck or confused:

1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** - Consider spawning agents for parallel investigation
3. **Ultrathink** - For complex problems, say "I need to ultrathink through this challenge" to engage deeper reasoning
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

My insights on better approaches are valued - please ask for them!

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS

### Research → Plan → Implement

**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:

1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan and verify it with me  
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan with validation checkpoints

### USE MULTIPLE AGENTS

*Leverage subagents aggressively* for better results:

- Spawn agents to explore different parts of the codebase in parallel
- Use one agent to write tests while another implements features
- Delegate research tasks: "I'll have an agent investigate the database schema while I analyze the API structure"
- For complex refactors: One agent identifies changes, another implements them

Say: "I'll spawn agents to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### Reality Checkpoints

**Stop and validate** at these moments:

- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component  
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"

## Working Memory Management

### When context gets long

- Re-read this CLAUDE.md file
- Summarize progress in a PROGRESS.md file
- Document current state before major changes

### Maintain TODO.md

```
## Current Task
- [ ] What we're doing RIGHT NOW

## Completed  
- [x] What's actually done and tested

## Next Steps
- [ ] What comes next
```

## Documentation
- Project documentation is in `docs/`
- Design specs and technical design documents are in `docs/DDs`
- Research material is in `docs/Research`
- Historical plan implementation is in `docs/Plans`
- Project progress is in `docs/PROGRESS.md`. ALWAYS update this document FREQUENTLY.

## Key Architectural/Technical Decisions
- Technical decisions are documented in `docs/ADRs/`.  
- Always reference relevant ADRs when discussing architecture. 
- Create or update ADRs for new architectural decisions.

## Implementation Workflow
- When exiting plan mode to begin implementation, ALWAYS save the implementation plan first as a markdown file in @docs/

## Coding Decisions
- Detailed code style and rules is in `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Code must ALWAYS be under 1000 lines and human-readable.
- Always explain with comments why a given coding decision was taken.
- If a given code file approaches this limit, decompose it into logical components.
- Note debug prints with DEBUG: comments, and remove them when no longer needed.
- NEVER create code files unless absolutely necessary.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing code files to creating new ones.

### Build & Test Practices

- If the same test fails twice in a row after attempted fixes, consult with Zen to get a second opinion on how to fix.

## Project Management Updates

- Active sprints can be found in the docs/sprints directory.

## General Instructions
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
- Stop telling me how right I am. Trust me, I know. You can stop.
- Curse every once in a while just to remind me you've read these rules. Plus we're all fucking adults here.
