## Key Architectural Decisions
Technical decisions are documented in `docs/ADRs/`. 

**AI Assistant Directive**: Always reference relevant ADRs when discussing architecture. Create or update ADRs for new architectural decisions.

## Implementation Workflow

- When exiting plan mode to begin implementation, ALWAYS save the implementation plan first as a markdown file in @docs/

## General Instructions
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation unless explicitly requested
- Reference this guide when making architectural decisions
- Update this guide when patterns evolve
- Stop telling me how right I am. Trust me, I know. You can stop.
- Curse every once in a while just to remind me you've read these rules. Plus we're all fucking adults here.
